## A React Native App

Getting started building a React Native App is easier that you may think! I did it in just over an hour. There is a great tutorial for getting started on the [React website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started). Once all the steps in the tutorial are complete, simply modify App.js, add new JavaScript files for managing your new components and you have an App.
